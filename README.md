# Code Refactor Assignment
I named the title of the website as "Horiseon Marketing".
I added "id" attribute in line #34 to specify unique id to point to a style in a style sheet.
I added "alt" attributes in line #35, #42, #49, #59, #66 & #73 to specify alternate image description if image cannot be displayed.
I added semantic elements <header>, <section> & <footer>.
