# Code Refactor Assignment:
The main focus of this project was to refactor an existing code to make sure it meets the accessibility standards. In order to achieve the standard, I have made a few changes to the HTML source codes. I have made sure that the HTML includes all the semantic elements and they follow a sequential order. The website now has a concise and descriptive title. Additionally, all the image elements have been given necessary alt attributes, that were missing in original HTML  source code. I have definitely tried to make sure I improve the code and make it cleaner than I found it. 

## My Experience:
As this was a very first programming project, it was a great learning experience for me. I was able to get a solid practice for HTML and CSS under my belt. Not only I was able to understand how HTML semantics work, but I was also able to understand how Cascading Style Sheet can help us manipulate different HTML elements within our website. It was a very fun project to work on and I am looking forward to working on more challenging projects in future. 

### Some changes made:
Title of the website as "Horiseon Marketing".
"id" attribute in line #34 to specify unique id to point to a style in a style sheet.
"alt" attributes in line #35, #42, #49, #59, #66 & #73 to specify alternate image description if image cannot be displayed.
Semantic elements <header>, <section> & <footer>.
